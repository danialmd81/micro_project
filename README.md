# Project Micro

## TODO

- Fix temperature handling for negative values and values greater than 63.
  
- Implement duplicate attendance warning:
  - If a student has already registered their attendance and tries to register again, a message with the content "حضور قبلاً ثبت شده است" should be displayed to prevent duplicate registrations.

- Use of GLCD (extra points):
  - For ease and convenience of viewing the menu, a GLCD can be used.
  - Hint: You can use LCD Vision.
