### Behdad

- Storing date and time (extra credit)
  - For each recorded attendance, store the exact date and time so that accurate attendance reports can be generated.

- Time limit for entering code (extra credit)
  - To prevent misuse, you can set a time limit for entering the manual code. For example, if the student does not enter the code within a specified time, the system automatically prevents attendance registration.
